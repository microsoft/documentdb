# Data Types

DocumentDB introduces the BSON data type within PostgreSQL, enabling storage and manipulation of rich, nested documents.

Supported BSON types include:
- Object
- Array
- String
- Number (int32, int64, double)
- Boolean
- Date
- Null

PostgreSQL's type system and indexing features work seamlessly with BSON values.

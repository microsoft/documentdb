# Introduction

**DocumentDB** is a fully open-source document-oriented database engine built as a native PostgreSQL extension.

It brings modern JSON-based document capabilities to PostgreSQL while maintaining compatibility with relational features.

DocumentDB is ideal for workloads that benefit from a flexible schema, powerful query language, and robust transactional guarantees â€” all backed by PostgreSQL.

## Database Structure

All sample data is inserted into the `sampledb` database to keep it separate from any existing data.

## Usage

These files are automatically executed when the DocumentDB container starts with the `--init-data=true` flag. They can also be run manually using mongosh:

```bash
mongosh localhost:10260 -u username -p password --authenticationMechanism SCRAM-SHA-256 --tls --tlsAllowInvalidCertificates --file 01-users.js
```
